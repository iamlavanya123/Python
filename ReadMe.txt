Operator Precedence (which operator takes precedence first?)
x = 1+2*3-4/5**6
5**6 (15625)
2*3 (6)
1+6-4/13625
1+6-0.0002935779816513761
approx 7


whats the operator precedence without brackets
>> parenthesis
>> power
>> multiplication, division, power
>> Addition , subtraction
>> adding left to right


Traceback means your programn stops running

because python throws Tracebacks
we can make use of try/except
-- you surround a dangerous section of code(that might break the code) inside try and except
if the code in the try works, except is skipped.
if the code in the try fails, it jumps to except section.


argument is the value that we pass into the function
parameter is the placeholder in the function definition

the variable used in loop is iteration variable while n<1 : (here is n is iteration variable)

the continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration.

indefinte loop -- while loop

while loops are called "indefinte loops" because they keep going until a logical condition becomes false.
